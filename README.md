Decentralized Port System Integrating Blockchain Electronic Bills of Lading and Smart Contracts

Traditional electronic bills of lading rely on centralized systems, facing interoperability barriers, single point of failure risks, and legal validity disputes. 

Blockchain technology addresses these core pain points through distributed ledger:

1. Anti-counterfeiting and Rights Confirmation: The entire lifecycle of the bill of lading (issuance, endorsement, transfer) is recorded on the blockchain as evidence, and the entire logistics process of the container (ship arrival → loading and unloading → warehousing → transportation) is recorded on the blockchain to ensure uniqueness and authenticity through immutability;
2. Decentralized Trust: Eliminating dependence on a single platform, establishing technical trust through cryptography and consensus mechanisms;
3. Full Process Insight: Authorizers can trace the circulation path of the bill of lading in real-time, enhancing transparency and simplifying auditing;

The role of the automation engine in smart contracts:

1. Seconds-level Release: After the recipient's payment verification, the contract automatically transfers the ownership of the bill of lading and triggers the port release instructions, compressing the pickup cycle from days to minutes;
2. On-chain Payment Collaboration: Ownership transfer simultaneously triggers payment settlement, eliminating risks of manual intervention;
3. Compliance Embedding: Automatically executes sanction screenings and letter of credit terms verification to ensure business compliance; port services (berthing fees/loading and unloading fees) are automatically settled, and insurance claims (delays/damage) are automatically processed based on IoT data;
4. Innovative Scenarios: Combining the Internet of Things and digital currency to achieve atomic exchange of "goods-funds" (DvP), reconstructing trade finance models.
